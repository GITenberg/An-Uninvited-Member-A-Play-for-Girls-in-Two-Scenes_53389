<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>It may represent a schoolroom, hall or campus,
to suit the convenience. Entrances right and left or one
entrance will be sufficient.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Florence</span> and <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> enter, arms entwined around each
other’s waists, whispering eagerly. They wear yellow
badges with black letters. <span class="smcap">Effie</span>, a little girl of eleven or
twelve, comes tiptoeing up behind, pounces on the entwined
arms and cries “Boo!” Girls jump and shriek
slightly, then confront <span class="smcap">Effie</span> indignantly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> Effie Warren, you’re a perfect little nuisance!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie</span> (<i>mimicking her</i>). Florence Dennis, you’re a perfect
big nuisance!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> How long had you been there behind us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Not under two seconds and not exceeding two
hours, Miss Vivian. Sorry I cannot tell any closer, but I
left my watch at home on the piano, and two hundred
miles is a bit too far to run before prayer time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> Did you hear what we said?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Don’t you wish you knew?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> Did you, Effie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> What’ll you give me not to tell, Miss Mason?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> A box of chocolates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Goody! Then I won’t tell. But when will you
give it to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> Run away, Effie. Florence doesn’t carry chocolates
to prayers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> I suppose not. “I shall be obliged to confiscate
these, young ladies (<i>very primly</i>), although it distresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
me very much to be obliged to do so.” Oh, Florence, what’s
your badge for? S. O. M. F. Is it a new society, and
can’t I join?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> Yes, Effie, it’s a new society. No, you can’t
join.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie</span> Why can’t I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> You are much too young and giddy (frivolous,
I should say) to understand the high motives and lofty
ideals of the S. O. M. F. You don’t even know who Socrates
was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie</span> No; but I know he’s nothing to do with your
society or you’d never have mentioned his name. I’m not
quite a baby, Miss Vivian, if my dresses aren’t down to
my ankles. My ankles aren’t so big I’m ashamed to show
’em, either! S. O.—Society Of—oh, I’ll find out your old
secret yet!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> Effie, you’re a perfect terror. (<i>Calling.</i>)
Betty! Betty!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Betty</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Oh, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> If you have any faint remnant of regard for
that small sister of yours, rescue her before I fall upon her
with evil intent and commit a fell and awful murder with
malice aforethought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Justifiable homicide, I should call it. What’s
the kidlet been doing now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). Kidlet yourself, Bettina Warren!
Oh, Betty, you’ve got a badge, too! Do tell me what S. O.
M. F. means. I’m dying to know!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Lillian</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Cheer up, Effie, we’ll all come to the wake.</p>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Maude</span> and <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>, arms entwined.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> To whose wake?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Are any of you girls going to commit suicide?
If so, count me out. I positively decline.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> It’s only my small sister here—no one that
counts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Don’t I? You may find out yet, Miss Bettina.
You think you’re so grown-up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> What you dying of, Effie? Unrequited affection
for the butcher’s boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> No, nor for the Professor’s boy, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> Good for you, Effie! Oh, Lil!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Saucy little bunch! Betty, why don’t you make
that kid behave?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Kid yourself! I’d like to see her try it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> I would not. Effie’s dying of unrequited curiosity,
Lil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Did you ever hear of Mother Eve, Effie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Yes, I have! And of Pandora, and Meddlesome
Matty, and Curious Carrie, and Bee Mortimer, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> Effie, you’ll surely be an old maid, your
tongue is so sharp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Hope I will. I wouldn’t marry one of those soft,
squashy, mushy academy boys you girls are so soft on for
anything. I’d rather have a cat and a parrot. <i>They</i> know
something, anyway. And I’m going to find out what those
letters stand for. S. O.—Society Of—M—Monkey—F—Fools.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girls</span> (<i>in chorus</i>). The idea!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> You’re a first rate guesser, Effie. You don’t
want to be a monkey fool, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Oh, I’ll guess it right yet. You see!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> I do believe she will, girls. She’s a perfect terror
at finding out things she ought not to know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> An investigating mind, hey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> Look out, Vivian! If Miss Dunham hears
you say “hey” she’ll give you another imposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> Who cares for Old Dunham? I’ll say “hey”
when I please, and straw, too, for all her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Say, girls, I met her this morning and she
put out her left hand to stop me—you know her way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie</span> (<i>mimicking</i>). Just so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Exactly, Effie. And she said, “Isn’t that a
rather conspicuous badge, Miss Mortimer?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> What did you say, Bee?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> I looked down at it as if I was just being
introduced to it, and answered modestly, “Is it, Miss Dunham?”
Then she read the letters slowly, but with as much
curiosity as Effie here, and said, “S—O—M—F—Society
of Moonlight Flirts.” (<i><span class="smcap">Girls</span> shriek with laughter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Pretty good for Dunham. Oh, why hadn’t
<i>we</i> thought of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> Really, that’s a great name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> Beats ours all hollow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> That’s even better than Effie’s “Monkey Fools.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> Better join forces with Dunham, Effie, and
ferret out that secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> You might call yourselves the “S. O. C. P.,”
Effie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Society of Curious Pryers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Thanks. I shan’t join forces with the enemy,
but I’m going to find out what those letters stand for, and
don’t you forget it. You’d better tell me and let me join.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> Well, you see, Effie, the membership is limited
to seven—the mystic number.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie</span> (<i>counting badges</i>). Betty, one; Maude, two;
Lil, three; Bee, four; Floss, five; Vivian, six; Effie, seven.
That just makes it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> But Dorothy’s to be number seven, Effie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Pooh! I saw Dorothy this morning, myself, and
she hadn’t a sign of a badge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence</span> (<i>taking badge from book</i>). Well, she’ll have
this one when I see her again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Oh, give it to me, Floss—do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> I can’t Effie, truly. It’s promised to Dorothy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Make me number eight, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> No. That will spoil it. Go get up a society of
your own with Hazel and Helen and Marjorie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> I’ll paint your badges, Effie, and never ask
what the letters stand for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Can’t switch me off that way. I’m going to find
out about that S. O. M. F. of yours, and I’m going to join.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
You’ll see! (<i>Snatches badge from <span class="smcap">Florence’s</span> hand and

the chapel is in the other direction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> But—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Dunham.</span> No excuses, please. The bell has rung
for prayers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> Mayn’t I—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Dunham.</span> If you mean may I not, Miss Atherton,
say so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> May I not—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Dunham.</span> Certainly not. Whatever you wish to
do, you must wait until after prayers. (<i><span class="smcap">Betty</span> attempts to
sneak off but is promptly recalled.</i>) Miss Warren, I shall
report you for insubordination and you will do one hundred
lines after school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence</span> (<i>aside</i>). Oh, ye gods and little fishes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Dunham.</span> Miss Dennis, I shall report you for
profanity. I have remarked before on your flippant manner
of conversation. Two hundred lines, please. Come,
young ladies, we’ll all be late to prayers. (<i>Ushers them all
before her in opposite direction to that taken by <span class="smcap">Effie</span>.</i>)</p>

that’s it. Society of Midnight. F—Fools—Flowers—Feasters.
Oh, ho! I’ve got it. S. O. M. F.—Society of Midnight
Feasters! Bee got a box from home yesterday. Well, you
can just bet little Effie’s going to join and attend the first
meeting. Now to learn where it’s to be.</p>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Hazel</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hazel.</span> Hurry up, Effie; you’ll be late to prayers. (<i>Sees
badge.</i>) Why, Effie Warren, where’d you get that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie</span> (<i>softly</i>). Don’t be inquisitive, Hazel. That’s the
badge of a new society within this Select Seminary for
Young Ladies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hazel.</span> Well, you don’t belong. It’s for the big girls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Doesn’t this look like it? My sister’s a member.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hazel.</span> So’s mine, but she wouldn’t even tell me what
S. O. M. F. stood for. (<i>Coaxingly.</i>) Won’t you, Effie
dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> The idea, Hazel Dennis! Don’t you know I
musn’t? It wouldn’t be honorable. I’m surprised at you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hazel.</span> H’m! Think you’re awful big, don’t you? I
know your old password, anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Bet you don’t!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hazel.</span> Well, I do. I heard Vivian tell Floss. She said:
“Tonight in Lil and Bee’s room, at the witching hour. Open
sesame—Bx!” So there, now! Seems as if you might have
found an English word instead of that Russian thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Well, I don’t know what they meant at all. Our
password is not Russian at all, but English. You’re way
off. There goes second bell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hazel.</span> Aren’t you coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Not just now. (<i><span class="smcap">Hazel</span> runs out.</i>) Bx! That’s
Russian for box, I suppose. And tonight at midnight! I’ll
be there. Oh, yes. Won’t it be fun to see the girls’ faces!

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>A bedroom in a boarding school. One door,

near center with a motley collection of food upon it.
<span class="smcap">Florence</span>, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>, <span class="smcap">Lillian</span>, <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> and <span class="smcap">Maude</span> sitting
around in various schoolgirl positions. <span class="smcap">Bee</span> jumps up and
begins to re-arrange table. <span class="smcap">Lillian</span> is seated near door. A
light knock heard. She opens door a crack. <span class="smcap">Betty</span> hisses
“Bx!” and is admitted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> Why wear such a sad and solemn face, Bettina?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> I can’t find Effie anywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> I can, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Oh, where is she, Floss? I was in the library,
reading up for my essay, and stayed overtime. Of course
the omnipresent Dunham had to meander down the corridor
as I was hiking for my room, and I got an impo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> You’d have got two, Betty mine, if the very
precise and proper Dunham had heard you make use of
that very expressive and slangy verb “to hike.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Well, when I got to my room Effie wasn’t there.
I thought she was hiding and hunted everywhere. But she
just wasn’t there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> Had you looked in mine you’d have found
her in bed with Hazel. I room with you tonight. I got permission
from Mrs. Waterman herself to exchange for tonight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> In ways best kept secret. An’ ye love me,
ask me no questions, I pray thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Where’s the dragon, Betsy Bobbet? Do you
know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Sound asleep in her room, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> Kindly let her remain there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> If she only <i>will</i>, Maudie. I shan’t drag her
forth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> All here. Time for initiation. Bring the prisoner
forward.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Vivian</span> and <span class="smcap">Maude</span> go behind a screen and come out
leading <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>, who is blindfolded. They place her before
<span class="smcap">Lillian</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Sisters in mystery, behold before you the aspiring
maiden who rashly dared to seek admittance to our
select circle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> I never, Lil Norton. You invited me yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Does the rash prisoner dare to speak unbidden?
Guard—the penalty. (<i><span class="smcap">Florence</span> passes a bottle of
pepper sauce.</i>) Put out thy bold and audacious tongue,
varlet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> I shan’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> You must, Dorothy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> Oh, go ahead, Dot. She’s put us all through
this before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> (<i>hesitatingly</i>). Well, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Fire—liquid fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> ’Twon’t hurt you, Doto.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Well—(<i>puts out tongue, draws it back. Does
it several times. At last <span class="smcap">Lillian</span> succeeds in putting pepper
sauce on it. <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> covering mouth with hands.</i>)
Whew! That burns like—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Water—only water, I assure you. Drawn
from the northeast corner of the deepest well in Byfield.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> If the taste doesn’t appeal to you, don’t answer
this august tribunal with back talk. Now for your
kittychasm. Answer promptly and respectfully. What is
your father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> A doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Her father is the undertaker’s partner, girls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). No such thing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Don’t the undertaker bury the ones he kills
for him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> The idea, Lil Norton! He doesn’t kill people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Then all his patients recover?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Well, no, of course, not all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Then they die?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Sometimes, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Then don’t try to hide from us who his partner
is. Perhaps in your town they don’t bury the doctor’s
victims. Do they cremate them, or mummify them, or simply
pickle them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Don’t, Lil. That’s horrid! They bury them,
of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Oh, you perceive, friends, that the culprit has
acknowledged that the learned doctor does have victims.
Here is a serious question for you. Shall we admit the
daughter of a murderer to our learned and elegant society?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> If you are going to insult my father, Lil
Norton, I don’t want to join your old society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Is the candidate getting touchy? Smooth her
ruffled feelings, guards. (<i><span class="smcap">Girls</span> smooth <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> vigorously.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> There! That will do. My feelings aren’t
ruffled any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Drop the candidate’s paternal parent with a
sharp thud. (<i><span class="smcap">Bee</span> drops a book.</i>) He is dropped. We will
proceed. Miss Mason, you may take up the cross-examination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> Does your mother ever wash her face?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> Is it seemly, sisters, to admit to our circle the
daughter of a washerwoman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> My mother isn’t a washerwoman, Vivian
Mason!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> Please confine your statements to the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Are we to understand
that your mother never washes her face?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Of course she does. She isn’t a pig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> Will the ladies please make a mental note of
the candidate’s last statement for future reference? Her
mother <i>isn’t</i> a pig! Then we are to understand that your
mother, being neither a pig nor a woman, is a man? How
passing strange! Does she wear a beard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> No, she doesn’t, and she isn’t a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> Third person, singular number, neuter gender.
Miss Dennis, your turn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> How old is your grandmother’s cat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> She hasn’t got a cat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> So the poor old lady can’t afford to keep a
cat! Does she reside in the poorhouse, or has she a tumble-down
hovel of her own?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Neither.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> You don’t mean that she’s a beggar on the
the street, I hope?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> No, I don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> Then please tell this assembly exactly how
and where she does live.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> She doesn’t. Both my grandmothers died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
years ago. One before I was born. The other immediately
after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> Oh, Dot, were you as homely as that? She
killed her own grandmothers. I’ve no more to ask. Proceed
with the inquisition, Miss Mortimer, while I recover
from the effects of the shock. A pickle, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> No; no pickles yet. The smelling salts are—somewhere.
(<i>To <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.</i>) When and where were you
born?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> In Boston, May 1, ——. (<i>Insert date to
fit age of girl taking the part.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> What day of the week?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Sunday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Ladies, she’s a Sabbath breaker. Very poor
taste, to say the least, to work the stork express on Sunday.
The hour of the day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Really, I don’t know. Does it matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Does it matter? Certainly it matters. If you
can’t tell when you were born, you can’t prove you were
born at all, and if, like Topsy, you “just growed,” you certainly
cannot be admitted to this select society, every member
of which was born.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Don’t be silly, Bee! Of course I
was born.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Were you present at the occasion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Sure! But I don’t remember much about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Was your mother present?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> I suppose she was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Suppose! Write to her immediately and ask
her if you were born. She may know, and it is very essential.
Miss Warren, it is your turn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Let us drop family matters, since they appear
so disgraceful, and find out if the candidate’s mental
achievements are such as entitle her to admission to our
select association. Can you read?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> (<i>putting a book in her hand</i>). Read this, please,
aloud, slowly, and with expression. Begin at the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
marked and read seven paragraphs. (<i><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> attempts to
pull bandage from eyes. <span class="smcap">Girls</span> prevent her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> I can’t read with this on my eyes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> (<i>taking book</i>). I feared it. Ladies, the candidate,
by her own admission, cannot read. Can you write?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Yes, I can do that blindfold, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Very well. Here are pencil and paper. Write
your name, please, if you know it. Also the name of this
delightful Alma Mater of ours. (<i><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> starts to write.</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> I can’t write if you girls—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girls</span> (<i>in chorus</i>). She can’t write! She can’t write!
She said so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> (<i>taking pencil</i>). Sad, sad indeed! Do you know
your letters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Probably not, according to you. You’re worse
than Miss Dunham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Try. Say your letters for the ladies, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> A, b, c, d, e—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Hold on! That isn’t the way!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Well, z, y, x, w—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> No, no! Say them correctly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> What gibberish! Say them in English.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> I did, but you wouldn’t let me go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> No, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Well, how shall I say ’em?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> One at a time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> All right. A.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Correct. Proceed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> B.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Yes? What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> I didn’t want you. C.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> See what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> A lot of idiots, I should say. D.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> That’s what she calls Bert, I suppose. Her dee
boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Oh, dry up, Maude. E.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> I regret to say that the candidate doesn’t know
her letters. She hasn’t given the definition of A yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Well, what is the definition of A?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> I am asking questions, not answering them.
One more trial. Can you define A?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> No, I can’t and I don’t want to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> I am overcome at the thought of such ignorance.
Miss Atherton may finish the kittychasm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> Can you do arithmetic? Add one cat, two
dogs, three bears and a lion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> Seven animals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> Wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> One, then—the lion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> That’s not addition; that’s subtraction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> No, because they’d all be added to the lion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> Wrong. The correct answer is, a big row.
Can you do multiplication? Do you know your times table?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> How many times have you been kissed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> What a question?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> I will make it simpler. How many times were
you kissed by a—er—young man? Bert, for instance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> The idea, Maude Atherton! I shan’t answer
another question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> The defendant pleads guilty. The last question
is answered. Kneel. (<i><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> kneels.</i>) Look up.
(<i><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> does so. <span class="smcap">Lillian</span> throws water in her face
Dorothy gasps. <span class="smcap">Girls</span> laugh. Another laugh is heard.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> What was that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> (<i>pointing</i>). Girls, look!</p>

<p><i>All look. See <span class="smcap">Effie</span> peeping from raised lid of box
couch. As they rush toward her she throws it back and
jumps out.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Effie Warren, you dreadful child. How did
you get here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Been here all the time. Came while you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Lil were squeezing lemons in the dressing-room. Sorry to
disturb you before the initiation was over, but you asked
such a heap of foolish questions, and its stuffy in there.
Besides, I was hungry. (<i>Makes a dive for the table, grabs
a cream cake and a pickle and begins to munch.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Effie Warren, you go straight back to your
room!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> If I do I’ll send Miss Dunham up here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Effie, you wouldn’t be so mean!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> I would if you were mean enough to turn me
out without my share of the spread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Your share! Well, I call that cool. You
weren’t invited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Perhaps not, but I’m a member of the S. O.
M. F., which means Society of Midnight Feasters, and I
know the password—Bx! See my badge?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Oh, Effie, you’re a regular Paul Pry. What
shall we do, girls?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Eat and decide afterward. See the young
gourmand stuff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Yes, it’s a first rate spread. (<i>All begin to eat.
Intersperse remarks such as “Pass the pickles,” “Isn’t this
great,” etc. The knob of the door rattles loudly. All pause
in dismay.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> (<i>from without</i>). Miss Norton! Miss Mortimer!
Young ladies. (<i>No response.</i>) Miss Norton! Miss Mortimer!
(<i>Loud rapping.</i>) Open this door! (<i>A pause.</i>) Do
you intend to obey? Very well, I shall fetch Mrs. Waterman.
(<i>Steps recede.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Scoot, girls, quick!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> We don’t dare. She’s probably waiting a little
way down the corridor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> What shall we do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> You and Lil get into bed quick. The rest of
us will hide. Effie, you’re little and spry, you blow out the
candle and unlock the door. Then get back into your former
hiding place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> All right.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Lillian</span> and <span class="smcap">Bee</span> scramble into bed, <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Betty</span> hide behind screen, <span class="smcap">Florence</span>, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> and <span class="smcap">Maude</span>
dive under bed. <span class="smcap">Effie</span> unlocks door, calmly fills her hands
and apron with goodies and gets into the box couch.
Someone knocks twice, then door opens and <span class="smcap">Mrs. Waterman</span>
enters.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Waterman.</span> Lillian! Beatrice! (<i>No answer. She
lights lamp and looks around her, advances to bed, holds
lamp high.</i>) Lillian! Beatrice! (<i>Still no answer. <span class="smcap">Girls</span>
appear to be asleep. She gives a quick glance behind screen,
then seats herself near table, occasionally glaring at or
beneath the bed. Talks aloud to herself.</i>) Well, I think
Miss Dunham must have been mistaken as to the number
of voices she heard. No one here but Beatrice and Lillian
and they sound asleep. I suppose their brains are weary
from over study. (<i>Looks at table.</i>) I suppose this is the
contents of Beatrice’s box. Spread out to see how much
show it would make, I presume. A midnight feast, Miss
Dunham seemed to think, but this seems hardly touched. I
believe I’ll try a glass of that lemonade. How prodigal of
Beatrice to make up so much at once. Doesn’t she know
it won’t be nearly so good in the morning? (<i>Pours out
lemonade and sips it.</i>) Delicious, I’m sure, and I believe
a slice of that cake would be nice. (<i>Takes it and tastes.</i>)
Ah, what an excellent cook Mrs. Mortimer is and what a
delicate, refined little lady. I’m glad she has brought up
her daughter to be sensible and keep her goodies for
morning, when they’ll be digestible. I told Miss Dunham
she was mistaken. Beatrice and Lillian are both
too fond of me to grieve me by such a flagrant breach
of rules. I told her she might go to bed and I’d go the
rounds and see who was missing. It seems unnecessary
now, however. (<i><span class="smcap">Betty</span> gives a slight cough, immediately
suppressed. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> looks toward bed.</i>) There,
Lillian has taken cold again. Her chest is so delicate. She
must take a bottle of cod liver oil, I think. I’ll give her
some in the morning. These things ought not to remain
here, they’ll attract the rats. Let me see, there’s that
clothes hamper. I’ll pack them in that and take them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
my room for safe keeping. I presume Beatrice will be
asking permission to have a party tomorrow afternoon or
evening. Let’s see. I believe I can guess whom she will
ask, even. Betty and Maude, Florence and Vivian and
Dorothy. “We are Seven,” and where one is, behold the
other six. Dear girls, I wonder if they know how truly I
have their interests at heart, and how well I love them all.
(<i>Packs basket, commenting on food. As she rises from
packing last of it, her eyes meet <span class="smcap">Effie’s</span>, peeping out from
couch. <span class="smcap">Effie</span> dodges back, <span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> advances, lifts cover
and motions her to get out.</i>) Why, Effie Warren! This is
a surprise. How did you come in there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> I hid when I heard you coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> But how came you here at all? What are you
doing in a room belonging to two large girls, when those
two girls are abed and asleep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Well, they didn’t want me and I just came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> And you have been eating Bee’s goodies! Oh,
what a pig! Did Bee give any of these to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> No’m, but—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> What do we call it when one person takes
another’s goods without their knowledge or permission?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Truly, I wasn’t stealing, Mrs. Waterman. The
idea! I wouldn’t! Besides they did know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> And said you might?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> N—no. But it wasn’t stealing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> Robbery, then, if you like that any better. A
little girl who forces herself on those who do not wish her
company is very bold and forward, indeed. How much
have you eaten, Effie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Two cream cakes, three tarts, two pickles, a
hunk of nutcake, a piece of pie, some macaroons. I guess
that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> I should hope so. Come with me to my room
and have a dose of castor oil, and then go back to bed with
Hazel as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> I don’t need any castor oil, Mrs. Waterman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> Indeed you do, after eating all of that in the
middle of the night. Here, help me carry this hamper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
(<i>They go out and close door. <span class="smcap">Girls</span> come out from hiding
places.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> Oh, I’m so cramped. Floss and Maude did
crowd so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> Crowd! I was way at the back, <i>being</i> crowded.
’Twas Floss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> Well, I was right in front and I was sure she
could see me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> And Betty coughed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Yes, and <i>I’ll</i> have to take cod liver oil to
cure it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Do you suppose she’ll make you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Of course. I can’t say it was Betty, can I?
Besides, she has been saying I ought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Girls, she knew we were there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> I believe she did!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude.</span> And talked for our benefit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> Made us feel pretty small, too. I’m glad she
got Effie, anyway. She did feel so big at getting the best
of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Say, girls, let’s make a clean breast of it and
tell her we’re sorry. (<i>Tears off badge.</i>) No more midnight
feasts for me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Nor me. Girls, S. O. M. F. is disbanded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> And nobody had a feast after all but that
troublesome little Effie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> And she’ll pay for hers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Indeed she will. No one can coax, hire, threaten
or force her to take castor oil at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> She was a little trump, though, and never
tattled a bit. Stood her sermon like a little martyr. Let’s
change our society to one where we needn’t sneak, and let
Effie join.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> So we will. Now, girls, let’s run, and in
the morning we’ll ’fess. We do think a lot of Mrs. Waterman,
and we’ll prove it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian.</span> Think of her sending Dunham to bed. <i>She’d</i>
have delighted in dragging us out one by one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> Yes, and we’d have been defiant and saucy
and in no end of a mess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span> And have done it all over as soon as possible,
whereas now—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> Now we solemnly promise to abjure midnight
feasting for a year and a day. Unpin badges. (<i>All
do so.</i>) March around and lay them on table. (<i>All do so.</i>)
I hereby declare the S. O. M. F. disbanded and solemnly
bury the regalia. (<i>Opens top drawer of bureau, puts
badges in and covers them, then closes drawer.</i>) Goodnight,
sisters in mystery. (<i>The girls all go out but <span class="smcap">Lillian</span>
and <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> (<i>as curtain falls</i>). I expected she’d feel my
pulse to see if I was feverish, my face burned so while she
talked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lillian.</span> And to think Effie was the only active member
of the S. O. M. F. after all!</p>

</div>

<p>Nearly all of these sketches were written for professionals
and have been given with great success by vaudeville
artists of note. They are essentially dramatic and
very funny; up-to-date comedy. They are not recommended
for church entertainments; however, they contain
nothing that will offend, and are all within the
range of amateurs.</p>

<p><b>DOINGS OF A DUDE.</b>—Vaudeville sketch, by Harry L. Newton; 2 m., 1 f.
Time 20 m. <i>Scene</i>: Simple interior. Maizy Von Billion of athletic tendencies
is expecting a boxing instructor and has procured Bloody Mike, a prize
fighter, to “try him out.” Percy Montmorency, her sister’s ping pong teacher,
is mistaken for the boxing instructor and has a “trying out” that is a surprise.
A whirlwind of fun and action.</p>

<p><b>FRESH TIMOTHY HAY.</b>—Vaudeville sketch, by Harry L. Newton; 2 m.,
1 f. Time 20 m. <i>Scene</i>: Simple rural exterior. By terms of a will, Rose
Lark must marry Reed Bird or forfeit a legacy. Rose and Reed have never
met and when he arrives Timothy Hay, a fresh farm hand, mistakes him for
Pink Eye Pete, a notorious thief. Ludicrous lines and rapid action.</p>

<p><b>GLICKMAN, THE GLAZIER.</b>—Vaudeville sketch, by Harry L. Newton
and A. S. Hoffman; 1 m., 1 f. Time 25 m. <i>Scene</i>: Simple interior. Charlotte
Russe, an actress, is scored by a dramatic paper. With “blood in her eye”
she seeks the critic at the office, finds no one in and smashes a window. Jacob
Glickman, a Hebrew glazier, rushes in and is mistaken for the critic. Fun,
jokes, gags and action follow with lightning rapidity. A great Jew part.</p>

<p><b>THE GODDESS OF LOVE.</b>—Vaudeville sketch, by Harry L. Newton; 1 m.,
1 f. Time 15 m. <i>Scene</i>: Simple exterior. Aphrodite, a Greek goddess, is a
statue in the park. According to tradition a gold ring placed upon her finger
will bring her to life. Knott Jones, a tramp, who had slept in the park all
night, brings her to life. A rare combination of the beautiful and the best of
comedy. Novel, easy to produce and a great hit.</p>

<p><b>HEY, RUBE!</b>—Monologue, by Harry L. Newton; 1 m. Time 15 m. Reuben
Spinach from Yapton visits Chicago for the first time. The way he tells of
the sights and what befell him would make a sphinx laugh.</p>

<p><b>IS IT RAINING?</b>—Vaudeville sketch, by Harry L. Newton; 1 m., 1 f.
Time 10 m. Otto Swimorebeer, a German, Susan Fairweather, a friend of
his. This act runs riot with fun, gags, absurdities and comical lines.</p>

<p><b>MARRIAGE AND AFTER.</b>—Monologue, by Harry L. Newton and A. S.
Hoffman; 1 m. Time about 10 m. A laugh every two seconds on a subject
which appeals to all. Full of local hits.</p>

<p><b>ME AND MY DOWN TRODDEN SEX.</b>—Old maid monologue, by Harry L.
Newton; 1 f. Time 5 m. Polly has lived long enough to gather a few facts
about men, which are told in the most laughable manner imaginable.</p>

<p><b>AN OYSTER STEW.</b>—A rapid fire talking act, by Harry L. Newton and
A. S. Hoffman; 2 m. Time 10 m. Dick Tell, a knowing chap. Tom Askit,
not so wise. This act is filled to overflowing with lightning cross-fires,
pointed puns and hot retorts.</p>

<p><b>PICKLES FOR TWO.</b>—Dutch rapid-fire talking act, by Harry L. Newton
and A. S. Hoffman; 2 m. Time 15 m. Hans, a German mixer. Gus, another
one. Unique ludicrous Dutch dialect, interspersed with rib-starting witticisms.
The style of act made famous by Weber and Field.</p>

<p><b>THE TROUBLES OF ROZINSKI.</b>—Jew monologue, by Harry L. Newton
and A. S. Hoffman; 1 m. Time 15 m. Rozinski, a buttonhole-maker, is
forced to join the union and go on a “strike.” He has troubles every minute
that will tickle the ribs of both Labor and Capital.</p>

<p><b>WORDS TO THE WISE.</b>—Monologue, by Harry L. Newton; 1 m. Time
about 15 m. A typical vaudeville talking act, which is fat with funny lines
and rich rare hits that will be remembered and laughed over for weeks.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
